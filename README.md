# Refactoring_SFelbeck

In this excersize, the [very important business client] has requested that I clean up the code of their website to make it more accesible.
In the HTML file none of the pictures had alt attributes which prevented browsers like google images from directing traffic to the site, which I have rectified.
There was also far too many div tags preventing specialized web readers from interpreting the code, I replaced as many of the div tags as I could with more appropriate tags.
Meanwhile the CSS file had many redundant functions all doing the same things from common parents, shortening these functions down to one each removed somewhere around 50-70 lines of redundant code.
Lastly it was requested that the CSS file had proper commenting, tbh I'm not sure what exactly that was defined as so I went ahead and commented everything to be safe, it might have been overkill.
Pls give me a promotion and lots of money, (boss name here)
